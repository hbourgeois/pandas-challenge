Observable Trends Found in the Data

Observation 1 - Student Population, School Types & Performance Rankings
	The Top 5 schools are all Charter schools with less than 2,500 students while the Bottom 5 schools are all district with student populations ranging from 2,917 to 4,761. Though the spend per-student is similar for the Top5 and Bottom5, the Student Population is a glaring difference leading one to conclude that a smaller school population will result in higher test scores. 
    
	An interesting extension for the data to explore this further would be to compare average class sizes at each school to see if thethe data proves a correlation between student to teacher ratios and test scores.


Observation 2 - Reading & Math Scores in Bottom5 School Rankings
	The data suggests that while the average math scores are fairly high, the percentage of students passing math is lower. This indicates a potential gap between average performance and the number of students meeting the passing criteria.

The reading scores and passing percentages are consistently higher than math, indicating stronger performance in reading across the schools. The overall passing percentages are the lowest among the metrics, highlighting a challenge in getting a significant portion of students to pass both math and reading.

These insights suggest that while students are performing reasonably well on average, there might be specific barriers preventing more students from achieving passing grades, especially in math.
